This project develops and tests a cross-sectional, volume-weighted momentum strategy across a 77-asset Binance universe using daily OHLCV data. Over 2020–2025, the strategy achieved a 1.36 gross Sharpe and 2.27 alpha t-stat versus Bitcoin’s 1.09 Sharpe. In-sample results (2023–2025) were weaker (1.00 alpha t-stat), while walk-back testing (2020–2023) maintained a 1.29 Sharpe and 1.84 alpha t-stat, indicating partial robustness. The project highlights a full quantitative research workflow—from data preparation and signal construction to parameter optimization and performance attribution.
